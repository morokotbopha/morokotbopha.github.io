        <p>When taking each step at a time with different pace, I am now a 14 years old students who is still exploring about the world and myself. Experiencing the teenage life is like an adventure after a leaf fall from the tree taken by the wind. After going through a toughtime and precious memories, I've realized life is always an unexpected path continuing for me to sit, walk or run. </p>

        <p>Art is an important part of me since I was young. I can have a canvas that never rejects my ideas and imagination to display on the paper as a piece of my soul. When it come to self-identify, I continue to stumble among numerous interests, life lessons, experiences that continue to build a pice of me. <br> <i>Aheah of me, an adventure awaits...</i></p>
