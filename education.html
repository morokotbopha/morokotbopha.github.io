        <p> <h3 id="ligermission">“CREATING A BRIGHTER FUTURE BY REALIZING THE POTENTIAL OF A PROMISING CHILD”</h3>On 9th September 2016, I stepped into the gate of school I'll be relying on for 7 years. An uncertainty grew in my mind and a question "What will I become in the next 7 years?" I went through all the recruiments and received a full scholarship to the capital of Cambodia, Phnom Penh. My decision was to travel from my province away from my parents and everythings I've known of to a school 124 km away from my home. It's been more than 3 years and I'm glad I have made this decision.</p>

        <p id="paragraph">Exploration is a project based-learning part of the model education. With real life experiences, we connect with the community and people around the country to create positive impacts. By engaging real issues in the outside world, we focus on big picture create solution to take action that create positive change.

        <h2>Essentials</h2>
        <p>Essential are consider to be the fundamental of Liger's educations. Every student including me takes four essential subjects every term which include English literacy, Khmer literacy, math, and science. Our teacher are called "Facilitator". They work alongside students to identify problem and design a solution to address the problem. To me, this shows another side of education. I've learned that education isn't just about knowledge, memorizing, writting notes and doing exercise. It is rather about fufilling all of the curiosity and gaining skills that can be used on the campus and beyond. On top of that, I do not only sit on the chair to listen to the facilitator but I interact with other students and ask questions.</p>
