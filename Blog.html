        <p> <h1>My Name | Personal</h1>Staring at the blossom flower, my name always pop up in my head. "Bopha" is a name of mine that means flower in my native language. Constantly reminding myself of a flower that grow, bloom and continue to learned from experiences. Blooming or shriveling, both of the two things has been part of me to let myself understand more about the meaning of life. My middle name is "Morokot" which is a precious stone​ with the color green. These two combinations has been a representation that others call when addressing me. </p>

        <p> <h1>Digital Art | Personal</h1>Since I was young, I am always passionate about drawing portraits. Sketching on the paper always seems like a pleasure. As more technology are created, I started to take interest in creating art using different software. One of the piece I've spent a long time to finished is Tradition dancer portrait inspired by a digital style Dolify doll discover by Dave Álvarez. This experience has shown me another way of expressing creativity. Even though there is a vast different between digital and traditional art, both has ability to hold the sense of creativity, imagination and reality.  </p>

        <p> <h1>Technovation | Experience</h1>Sitting in front of my computer typing lines of programming, I almost laugh out loud about the gap of my feeling toward programming 3 years ago compare to the present day. 3 years ago if anyone ask "Do you like programming?" I would definitely reply with a big fat <i>NO</i> along with headache. When I first starting to learn about it, It was the most stressful subject ever. One day, Girls in my school are given the opportunity to join a program that teach coding and entrepreneurship. After a year of experience, I suddenly found myself continued to join the program for another 2 years in row. Accomplishment with my teams winning the nation pitch twice and was selected to be the semi-finalist a step away from joining the global competition in San francisco are a big part of the experience but the journey itself is what I treasured the most. </p>

        <p> <h1>9th e-Icon | Experience</h1>During August 2019 I attended the 9th e-ICON world contest held in busan, korea. The contest are made up of many participant from different places. Competitive would never suitable to describe the contest due to the fact that I always feel relaxed by how other participant communicate with other without the eagerness to win over the other. The contest require us all to create an application to solve problem in society. The problem My team has chosen was about disability. During of developing the software itself, one of my korean temmate and I went off to interview a disbility communicity about their experiences living with disability. We won the 2nd place among all of the teams from different countries. The teamwork and experiences of the contest remind me that knowing new people, learning different cultures and helping to solve problem in the society will be another memorable experience added to my list.</p>

Apart from the contest I was participating, the place kind of always a peaceful sound that hum through my ear. Everyday in those 5 days, I woke up to the sound of waves through the window. Another part I enjoyed about busan are the people, the culture and the delicious food. </p>

        <p> <h1>Outdoor Leadership | Experience</h1>The breeze wind of eastern region of cambodia brushed my face along with the heat from the camp fire. I woke from a good night sleep still drownsy from sleeping as I talk to the other friends. After being in an exploration called “Outdoor Leadership”, my perspective has changed that outdoor trip is more broad and different perspective from what’s been done before. It was more than eating in the waterfall and take a picture to show that we’ve been there. It was about exploring the connection we have with nature around us and enjoying the real experience with our feet touching the ground and sweat dripping. This unforgettable experience taught me how to be a leader responsible for yourself, helping your teammates and diving deeper about the question "What does nature mean to me?".</p>
